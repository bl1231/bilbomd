# @bilbomd/bilbomd-types

## 1.5.4

### Patch Changes

- 964095e: Surface step progress messages on the public job page. The FoXS step now writes periodic progress text (e.g. "FoXS: 1800/3600 (50%)") to the MongoDB step message alongside the BullMQ update. The public job API now includes steps data, and the public job progress box displays the latest step message below the progress bar.

## 1.5.3

### Patch Changes

- d0504b0: Fix UI cofactor alerts to reflect GAFF2 support for organic small molecules. Split STRIPPABLE_COFACTORS into GAFF_COFACTORS (organic, now parameterized via GAFF2) and METAL_COFACTORS (heme/porphyrins, still removed). FAD and similar molecules now show a blue info alert instead of a yellow warning.

## 1.5.2

### Patch Changes

- 57f8495: Bump non-major npm dependencies (bullmq, vite, vitest, react-router, openid-client, prettier, typescript, and others).

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 82d0bf4: Remove md_engine from base job schema for scoper jobs. Scoper uses KGSRNA for
  conformational sampling, not CHARMM or OpenMM. Moving md_engine to only the
  discriminator schemas that use an MD engine (pdb, crd, auto, alphafold, sans).
  Also adds md_engine explicitly to the SANS discriminator schema where it was
  previously relying on the base schema default. The md_engine field is now
  optional in BaseJobDTO and AnonJobResponse.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f3ca090: Add support for mmCIF (.cif) file uploads in Classic/pdb and Auto job types.

  Users can now upload AlphaFold 3 (or any standard mmCIF) files directly into BilboMD without manual conversion. The frontend and backend validate chain IDs and residue names from the `_atom_site` loop block using the same `SUPPORTED_PDB_RESIDUES` allowlist used for PDB validation. The worker converts CIF to PDB at pipeline start using biopython before CHARMM or OpenMM processing.

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- fc1be50: Move the supported PDB residue list to a single constant (`SUPPORTED_PDB_RESIDUES`) in `@bilbomd/bilbomd-types`, shared by both the backend validator and the frontend `hasAllowedResiduesOnly` check. Eliminates the risk of the two lists diverging silently. Also adds common ions (MG, CA, ZN, etc.) and HSD to the allowed set, and adds the missing `pdbCheck()` to the Auto job form schema.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 474cef7: Add results_ready flag to track results packaging outcome independently of job status.

  Jobs that complete all MD science steps but fail during final tar.gz creation now remain
  Completed rather than Failed. A new results_ready boolean field (false by default) is set
  to true only after a successful archive is created, making the packaging outcome observable.

  The UI disables the Download Results button and shows a warning when results_ready is false,
  and surfaces download errors to the user via an Alert instead of silently logging to console.

## 1.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 0daf2a4: improved cicd pipeline

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 690bed9: Update mongoose from v8 to v9.
  Split `backend` tests into unit and integration

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 16f7879: # Usage Analytics & Admin Dashboard

  **Branch:** `238-store-job-stats-in-mongodb`
  **Target:** `main`

  ## 🎯 Core Feature: Usage Analytics & Admin Dashboard

  Added comprehensive usage analytics infrastructure across the BilboMD stack:
  - **📊 Analytics Dashboard:** New admin UI with interactive charts and KPI cards displaying job success rates, pipeline trends, duration statistics, and access mode splits
  - **📝 Usage Event Tracking:** Job lifecycle events (submitted/started/completed/failed) stored in MongoDB with user context, IP hashing, and NERSC metadata
  - **🔌 Backend Analytics API:** Protected endpoints for aggregating usage statistics with role-based access control (Admin/Manager only)
  - **⚡ Worker Pipeline Integration:** All job pipelines (auto/crd/pdb/sans/multi/scoper) now emit structured usage events

  ## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

  ### Database & Schema
  - New `UsageEvent` MongoDB collection with optimized indexes for analytics queries
  - Usage event interfaces and DTOs in shared packages

  ### Backend
  - 9 new analytics controller endpoints under `/admin/analytics`
  - Usage event service for centralized event recording
  - Job submission tracking for both authenticated and anonymous users

  ### Frontend
  - New RTK Query `analyticsApiSlice` for data fetching
  - Responsive analytics dashboard with time-range filtering
  - Complete test coverage for all analytics components

  ### Worker & Services
  - Usage event emission across all pipeline services
  - NERSC job monitoring with status tracking

  ## 🧪 Testing & Quality
  - **Comprehensive test suite** for all new analytics components
  - **Unit tests** for utility functions (dates, PDB utilities)
  - **Component tests** using Vitest with proper mocking patterns
  - **Follows project standards** with functional components and TypeScript strict typing

  ## 📚 Documentation
  - Usage analytics aggregation guide with MongoDB pipeline examples
  - Updated Copilot instructions with testing best practices
  - Detailed changeset documentation for future reference
